# work-day-scheduler - JavaScript - Luxon

## Description

This is my daily scheduler/ planner!

Check out my deployed page at: https://mgsteinmetz.github.io/work-day-scheduler/ !!

Below is a picture of my planner UI. I implemented the current date, and local time using Luxon ( seen at the top of the page ).

The user is able to type an event that they have, and save it by clicking on the save icon to the right of the text area! 

I implemented saving events by using local storage.

Each timeblock will change color throughout the day based on past, present, and future.
